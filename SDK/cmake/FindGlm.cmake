# Locate the glm files

# This module defines the following variables:
#
# GLM_INCLUDE_DIR  where to find glm include files.
# GLM_FOUND        true if both the GLM_INCLUDE_DIR and GLFW3_INCLUDE_DIR have been found.
#
# To help locate the library and include file, you can define a 
# variable called GLFW3_ROOT which points to the root of the glfw library 
# installation.
#

# default search dirs
