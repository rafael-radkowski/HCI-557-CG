/*
@file: VertexBuffer.h/.cpp

This file contains helper function to create a vertex buffer object and to 
load data into the vertex buffer. It can simplify the content creation since
the vertex buffer call is mostly repetative.

- Added a int cast to some functions to prevent 4 byte vs. 8 byte conflicts.
